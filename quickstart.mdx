## Welcome to HolySuck API

This quickstart guide will help you make your first API call to HolySuck in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

First, you'll need to obtain an API key from the HolySuck dashboard.

1. [Sign up for a HolySuck account](https://app.holysuck.com/signup)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy your API key (keep it secure!)

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables or secure config management.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Make Your First API Call

Let's start by getting your user profile to verify everything is working.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.holysuck.com/v1/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.holysuck.com/v1/users/me', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const user = await response.json();
console.log(user);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.holysuck.com/v1/users/me', headers=headers)
user = response.json()
print(user)
```

```go Go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    client := &http.Client{}
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.holysuck.com/v1/users/me", nil)
    req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY")
    req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
    
    resp, _ := client.Do(req)
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    
    body, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Expected Response

If everything is configured correctly, you should receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": "user_12345",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}
```
